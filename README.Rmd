# koanr

`koanr` is (mostly) a data package containing the text for several of the more important Zen koan texts: The Gateless Gate (`gateless_gate`), The Blue Cliff Record (`blue_cliff_record`), The Record of the Transmission of the Light(`record_of_light`), and The Book of Equanimity(`book_of_equanimity`). `koanr` also includes functions for sampling (real) koans and generating (fake) koans.


## Example

Sample from an existing koan:

```{r koan, results='asis', message=FALSE}
library(koanr)
koan(collection = gateless_gate, case = 1)
```

Or generate a fake one:

```{r fake_koan, results='asis'}
fake_koan()
```
