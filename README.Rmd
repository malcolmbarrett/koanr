# koanr

`koanr` is (mostly) a data package containing the text for several of the more important Zen koan texts: The Gateless Gate, The Blue Cliff Record, The Record of the Transmission of the Light, and The Book of Equanimity. `koanr` also includes functions for sampling (real) koans and generating (fake) koans.


## Example

```{r example, results='asis'}
library(koanr)
fake_koan()
```
