koanr
=====

`koanr` is (mostly) a data package containing the text for several of the more important Zen koan texts: The Gateless Gate (`gateless_gate`), The Blue Cliff Record (`blue_cliff_record`), The Record of the Transmission of the Light(`record_of_light`), and The Book of Equanimity(`book_of_equanimity`). `koanr` also includes functions for sampling (real) koans and generating (fake) koans.

Example
-------

Sample from an existing koan:

``` r
library(koanr)
koan(collection = gateless_gate, case = 1)
```

Collection: The Gateless Gate

Case \#1: Joshu's Dog

Main Case: A monk asked Joshu, 'Has the dog the Buddha nature?' Joshu replied, 'Mu (nothing)!'

Commentary: Mumon's Comment: For the pursuit of Zen, you must pass through the barriers (gates) set up by the Zen masters. To attain his mysterious awareness one must completely uproot all the normal workings of one's mind. If you do not pass through the barriers, nor uproot the normal workings of your mind, whatever you do and whatever you think is a tangle of ghost. Now what are the barriers? This one word 'Mu' is the sole barrier. This is why it is called the Gateless Gate of Zen. The one who passes through this barrier shall meet with Joshu face to face and also see with the same eyes, hear with the same ears and walk together in the long train of the patriarchs. Wouldn't that be pleasant? Would you like to pass through this barrier? Then concentrate your whole body, with its 360 bones and joints, and 84,000 hair follicles, into this question of what 'Mu' is; day and night, without ceasing, hold it before you. It is neither nothingness, nor its relative 'not' of 'is' and 'is not.' It must be like gulping a hot iron ball that you can neither swallow nor spit out. Then, all the useless knowledge you have diligently learned till now is thrown away. As a fruit ripening in season, your internality and externality spontaneously become one. As with a mute man who had had a dream, you know it for sure and yet cannot say it. Indeed your ego-shell suddenly is crushed, you can shake heaven and earth. Just as with getting ahold of a great sword of a general, when you meet Buddha you will kill Buddha. A master of Zen? You will kill him, too. As you stand on the brink of life and death, you are absolutely free. You can enter any world as if it were your own playground. How do you concentrate on this Mu? Pour every ounce of your entire energy into it and do not give up, then a torch of truth will illuminate the entire universe.

Capping Verse: Has a dog the Buddha nature? This is a matter of life and death. If you wonder whether a dog has it or not, You certainly lose your body and life!

Case \#37: The Seventeenth Ancestor, The Sainted Anabotei.

Main Case: Gisei opened up completely and was immediately awakened to his TRUE SELF. Kayashata pointed out to me.” Nyojo said, “The Buddha said, ‘When one pursues the supernormal powers of a fox for 500 rebirths and am still not putting the Noble Truths into practice, in what I do not see, that is of course not what I do not say this sooner? Upon hearing this Bashumitsu awoke to his TRUE SELF. Hôgen suddenly attained a great awakening to his room. The monk asked Unmon about this. Bowing humbly, Sokaku said, “Why is what I do not.” The Second Patriarch, Suika, stood long in the delusory state of a rishi or devotes himself to the end, if you give up further efforts, it will not find IT if I assert that ‘IT is indeed to drop off body and mind, he is giving a great awakening to his room. Ungo once pointed out, “Since you wish to realize it, just like a man capable of discerning warm and cold by tasting water. He has entered the gate than Nagyaarajuna realized what an astute person he was asked a question about Zen. Great Master Kanchi, Doshin said, “Please, Reverend Monk, out of the temple. Rinzai then took his sandals, put them upon his head to Gutei, Gutei raised his head. Bodaidaruma said, “You are really not yet grasped that the light has not yet able to hear my teaching of the temple. When Shayata heard these words Yakusan had a great awakening to his quarters. This shows that the light has not yet heard my teaching of the Great Mount I, Maser Hyakujo told the chief monk and all its sentient beings, simultaneously.” In the old woman gave the same question and the great earth, towers, palaces, people, animals, and other things. Thereupon, the World-Honored One smiled.

Commentary: Yet, in that land there have been able to say.” Although this simple mountain monastic, was given by the master, not a genuinely liberated persons. Manura answered, “Here is the ocean, his persuasive instruction and spiritual guidance were beyond measure. When you have to lower and roll up his son, allowing him to his very birth he far excelled others; in his beak, He will bear no likeness to that of others. Look inwards and probe deeply day and night until, in the four types of karma for their minds are as the genuine Vehicle. After Ejo finally received the Tathagata’s entrustment, rose upon this and all sounds are thus made manifest. Even though He had not yet able to see future births and deaths, is to be ‘encountering smoke’. Throughout the twenty-four hours of a phrase or show familiarity with some phrase?” However when you speak of ‘sound’, hearing and seeing are impossible but, because having him seemed misfortunate to her, “As I do not.” Such are those who chant Scriptures.

Capping verse: Not climbing on the Four Dhyana Heavens. The one who could not, Both of them obtained freedom. Do you wish to append my humble words to what is happening in this story. Now, how can there possibly be, any body or mind existing from the past to the eyes! Turning page after page,, oh how many times, has the WE come forth, wearing a different face? Do you all like to append my humble words in the interest of pointing out what is happening in the preceding story?
